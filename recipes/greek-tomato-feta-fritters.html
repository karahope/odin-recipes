        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>There are so many great ways to enjoy fresh, sweet summer tomatoes, 
            and much to my shock and amazement, these Greek-style fritters could 
            be my new favorite. This is a major surprise, since I generally don't 
            enjoy large, hot chunks of fresh tomato in a recipe. I'm okay with 
            them being cooking down, and disappearing into a sauce, but I find 
            them texturally challenging when they remain intact. Unless they're 
            inside a crispy, herb-and-cheese-studded, fried fritter. In that case, 
            I can't get enough.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>2 cups diced fresh tomatoes with juices</li>

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>There are so many great ways to enjoy fresh, sweet summer tomatoes, 
            and much to my shock and amazement, these Greek-style fritters could 
            be my new favorite. This is a major surprise, since I generally don't 
            enjoy large, hot chunks of fresh tomato in a recipe. I'm okay with 
            them being cooking down, and disappearing into a sauce, but I find 
            them texturally challenging when they remain intact. Unless they're 
            inside a crispy, herb-and-cheese-studded, fried fritter. In that case, 
            I can't get enough.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2> 
        
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups diced fresh tomatoes with juices</li>
            <li>½ cup packed grated zucchini</li>
            <li>⅓ cup sliced green onions</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped fresh Italian parsley</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>3 ounces feta cheese, crumbled</li>
            <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
            <li>¾ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Stir together tomatoes, zucchini, green onions, kosher salt, 
                sugar, black pepper, oregano, and cayenne in a bowl to 
                combine.</li>
            <li>Let sit for 15 minutes for the sugar and salt to draw out 
                liquids from the vegetables.</li>    
            <li>Stir the tomato mixture; add parsley, mint, and basil. Crumble 
                in feta cheese. Add flour and baking powder; mix with a spoon 
                until combined. Batter should be relatively loose but will hold 
                its shape on a spoon. If too loose, add more flour; if too dry, 
                add some water until desired consistency is reached.</li>
            <li>Wrap the bowl in plastic wrap and let chill in the refrigerator 
                for at least 30 minutes.</li>  
            <li>Heat 1 inch of vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat 
                to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), or use a deep fryer.</li>  
            <li>Place heaping tablespoonfuls of batter in the hot oil; reduce heat 
                to medium. Fry until golden brown and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes 
                per side. Flip once more and fry for an additional 30 seconds, if 
                desired. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>  
        </ol>

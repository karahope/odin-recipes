        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Homemade potato chips are fun and easy. Guaranteed they won't last 
            long! A food processor with a slicing attachment is very helpful for 
            slicing the potatoes. Experiment with the thickness; you may like them
            thicker or thinner. I like to use olive oil for frying, but you can 
            use safflower, corn, or peanut oil as well as vegetable oil.</p>
